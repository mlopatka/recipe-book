Ingredients

	•	6 figs 
	•	6 slices prosciutto 
	•	5 ounces blue cheese (soft, such as Gorgonzola, chopped)
	•	2 tablespoons butter 
	•	1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 
	•	1 teaspoon brown sugar 

Directions

1.	Preheat oven to 375°F. Cut a cross on the top of each fig and gently 
press at base to open slightly. Wrap a slice of prosciutto around each fig and place a little cheese in opening.

2.	For the glaze, melt butter in a small ovenproof frying pan on medium. Remove from heat. Stir in vinegar and sugar. Place figs upright in pan so that they fit snugly. Bake 15 mins, until cheese has melted and figs have softened slightly. Serve immediately.
