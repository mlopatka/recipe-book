    4 Beets
    3 Qts Beef Broth (or Veggie)
    One Ham bone (omit if using for Christmas Eve Borscht)
    2 Parsnips
    2 Bay Leaf
    2 Chopped Onions
    Small Box of Chopped Mushrooms
    2 Chopped Apples
    1 Large Leek
    Bunch of Fresh Parsley
    Juice of whole lemon
    2 Tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar
    2 Teaspoon Cumin
    2 Tablespoon Dill
    2 Teaspoon Thyme
    Garlic
    Salt
    Pepper

1.  Carefully wash the beets, peel and slice thinly.  Add to a large stock pot with ham bone and add beef broth and bay leaf and let simmer for 20-30 minutes.  

2.  While soup is simmering, chop the rest of the vegetables and add rest of ingredients to the soup.   Add more beef broth to cover all vegetables and simmer slowly for another 30 minutes.  

3.  Remove ham bone and cut up any small pieces of meat to add back to soup.  

4.  If you like a "creamier" soup, use a hand-held blender and simply blend Borscht till desired thickness.  (Some like small chunks of veggies and more of a broth for Borscht soup, so a blender is not recommended for this type of flavor).

5.  IMPORTANT:  taste soup.  You may need to add salt, pepper, dill, and vinegar.  One little trick we did that turned out amazing was to add finely chopped Sauerkraut and juice.  Typical Polish Borscht soups should have fermented beetroot juice which gives it a "tangy" flavor, but this was a nice shortcut that was better than just adding vinegar.  Make sure you use Sauerkraut that is only made with water and salt -- the real thing.
