INGREDIENTS
	•	1/2 cup unsalted butter melted and cooled slightly
	•	1 cup all-purpose flour
	•	1 cup yellow cornmeal (or polenta)
	•	1/4 cup brown sugar (or white granulated sugar)
	•	1 teaspoon baking powder (optional: yields a fluffier cornbread)
	•	1/2 teaspoon baking soda
	•	1/4 teaspoon salt
	•	1 cup buttermilk shake before measuring
	•	1/4 cup honey
	•	2 large eggs
	•	(optional) 6 fresh jalapeño peppers
	•	(optional) 1 tsp red wine vinegar
	•	(optional) 1 tbsp olive oil


INSTRUCTIONS

	•	Preheat the oven to 200C | 400F and position a rack in the middle. Lightly grease a 9-inch cast iron skillet or 9-inch square baking dish with butter and place skillet/dish into the oven to heat up.   (Alternatively for cast iron skillets: heat 1/2 cup of unmelted butter in your cast iron over stove top on medium heat until melted, turn heat off then allow the butter to cool slightly before adding to the batter.)  
	•	In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder (If using), baking soda and salt.  
	•	Make a well in the centre and add the buttermilk, honey and eggs. Mix together well to combine, then add in the slightly cooled melted butter. Mix again until 'just' combined (don't over mix). 
	•	(optional) step for a spicy cornbread: slice jalepenos and remove some of the seeds (up to you how spicy you want to go, more seeds left makes a more intense heat). slice the peppers to make rounds and sauté in a pan with olive oil. Add a tsp of red wine vinegar and simmer on low heat until the peppers are soft. Fold this mixture to the batter with a spatula just before pouring the batter into the hot pan (next step).
 
	•	Carefully remove your 'hot' pan or dish from the oven with oven mitts, and pour the batter into the hot skillet or dish. Listen to that sizzle! That's what you want.  
	•	Bake until the cornbread begins to brown on top and a toothpick inserted in the centre comes out clean (about 20-23 minutes). Allow to cool for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving.  
NOTES
If you don't have buttermilk, you can make your own! Add 1 tablespoon of white vinegar (or fresh squeezed lemon juice) to 1 cup of room temperature milk (full cream, 2% or skim can be use). Mix together and let sit for 5 minutes. Done! Prepare your 'buttermilk' as step one of this recipe to ensure it has soured enough before adding to your mixture.
