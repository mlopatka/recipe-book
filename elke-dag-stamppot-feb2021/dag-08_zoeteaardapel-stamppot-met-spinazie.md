## Ingredients
* 1.5kg sweet potatoes or yams (Japanese yams work well, but so do orange yams)
* 350g fresh or frozen spinach
* 200g walnut pieces
* 450g soft unripened goat cheese
* 50g butter
* 100g pumpkin seeds
* salt and pepper

## Preparation
* Peel and cut sweet potatoes into ~4-5cm cubes and place in a large pot. Fill up with cold tap water until they are completely submerged. 
* Rinse and dry spinach leaves. If using frozen spinach lay it out to thaw and dry on paper towel to reduce the moisture.
* Bring sweet potatoes to a rolling boil and cook until soft enough than a fork easily passes through (about 20 minutes).
* Drain the sweet potatoes and let residual moisture evaporate for 2 minutes. 
* Combine spinach leaves while the sweet potatoes are still hot and mash together with butter, goat cheese, and walnuts.
* Serve immediately with pumpkin seeds sprinkled on top.
