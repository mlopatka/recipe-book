## Ingredients
* 4 medium-sized leeks (approximately 400g)
* 600g soft-cooking potatoes (russet work fine)
* 2 tbsp warm milk
* 2 tbsp butter
* 3 tbsp creme fraiche (sour cream as a reasonable substitute)
* salt and pepper
* 400-500g of salmon filet
* one whole lemon
* soya sauce

## Preparation
* Trim leeks discarding tough green parts and slice into rings.
* Peel and cut potatoes into ~4-5cm cubes and place in a large pot. Fill up with cold tap water until the potatoes are completely submerged. Add chopped leeks to the same pot. Bring to a rolling boil and cook until the potatoes are soft enough than a fork easily passes through (about 15-20 minutes).
* Trim the ends off of the lemon and add to boiling potato/leek water
* Preheat oven to 200C.
* Wash the salmon fillet with cold water and lay it on a sheet of aluminum foil skin-side down. Sprinkle with salt lightly and pour a light drizzling of soja sauce over the filet. Cover the fillet wiht thinly slices lemon rounds, using up the entire lemon. Wrap in aluminum foil forming a closed pouch. Place the salmon in the oven for 25 minutes to bake. In the last 5 minutes of baking open foil and turn oven to broil setting.
* Combine the butter and milk in a small pan and heat until melted.
* Drain the potatoe/leek pot and let residual moisture evaporate for 2 minutes. Remove the lemon ends and discard. Mash together with milk butter mixture and creme fraiche until a homogenous consistency is achieved with a masher.
* Arrange on plate with a thick layer of potato/leek and place the salmon fillet on top wiht a fresh lemon slice.
