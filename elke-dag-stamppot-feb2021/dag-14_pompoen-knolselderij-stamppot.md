## Ingredients
* 600 g soft-cooking potatoes (russet works fine)
* 350 g celeriac (celery root)

* 80 g butter
* pepper and salt 
* 2 tsp thyme
* 1 tsp olive oil
* 4 large eggs
* Vegetable bullion stock cube

## Preparation
* Peel and trim pumpkin and celeriac and chop into 2-3cm sized cubes. 
* Coarsely dice a large red onion (or 2 small/medium onions).
