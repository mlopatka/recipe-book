## Ingredients
* 1 kg soft-cooking potatoes (russet works fine)
* 1/2 of a large green chinese cabbage (approx. 500g) substitute for savoy cabbage if you want a sweeter flavour
* 300 g pork loin
* 2 tsp olive oil
* 100ml milk
* pepper and salt 
* 1 sweet white onion
* 2 tbsp ketjap manis 
* 1 tbsp brown sugar
* 1 tbsp coarse rock salt
* 1 tsp rice vinegar

## Preparation
* Rinse the pork loin and pat dry on a plate. Brush the meat's surface with rice vinegar, then sprinkle on equal amounts of rock salt and white sugar until uniformly coated. Cover with plastic wrap and set asside in the fridge (this can be done up to a day in advance to save preparation time later). 
* Peel and cut potatoes into 2-3 cm chunks and place along wiht diced white onion into a large pot. Cover 2/3 of the way with water, and boil until the potatoes are soft, or approx. 20 minutes.
* Chop the cabbage into thin slices perpendicular to the cabbage grain direction. When potatos have been boilnig for 10minutes add the chopped cabbage tot he same pot and bring back to a boil. 
* Heat a skilet or frying pan up to high heat, with a low smoke-point oil (we use grapeseed oil) and sear the pork loin strips mocing them around constantly to avoid burning, but ensure a dark maillard finish.
* Pour off excess fluid from the potato/onion/cabbage mixture and add the butter, salt and pepper, and ketjap. Mash until a homogeneous blend is achieved.
* Serve hot stamppot topped wiht pork loin strips and (optional) dry fried onions sprinkled on top.
