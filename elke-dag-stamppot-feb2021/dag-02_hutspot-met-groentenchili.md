## Ingredients

## Preparation
This day was using up leftover hutspot and leftover vegetarian chilli that were both in portions too small to make up a full meal.  
* The hutspot recipe can be found [here](https://github.com/mlopatka/recipe-book/blob/master/elke-dag-stamppot-feb2021/dag-05_hutspot-met-witvis.md)
* The chilli recipe can be found here [here](https://github.com/mlopatka/recipe-book/blob/master/elke-dag-stamppot-feb2021/dag-02_hutspot-met-groentenchili.md)

Reheat the hutpot in a non-stick deep saucepan keeping it from burning with a spatula. Meanwhile reheat the chilli in a pot. Serve hot with whatever additional leftover cheese you would like to grate on top.

### Eet Smakelijk!
