<ul>
<li>1kg soft-cooking potatoes, russet works fine)</li>
<li>2 aubergines (approx. 450g)</li>
<li>1 big red onion)</li>
<li>3 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>350g button mushrooms / champignons (quartered)</li>
<li>tomato paste (140g can)</li>
<li>100g of ripened sheep cheese (shredded)</li>

<h2 id="prep">Prep</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cut aubergines lengthwise into 4 parts of approximately equal thickness. Lightly brush them with olive oil, lay them out on a siblge layer on a cookie sheet and sprinkle with coarse salt (about 2 tsp). Bake (from cold) in the oven at 180Â°C for 45 minutes until lightly charred and browning. They should be very aromatic and loose about 20% water mass, your kitchen is goign to smell great.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, peel and cut potatoes into ~4-5cm cubes and place in a large pot. Fill up with cold tap water until the potatoes are completely submerged. Bring to a rolling boil and cook until the potatoes are soft enough than a fork easily passes through (about 15-20 minutes).</li>
<li>While the potatoe are boiling, slice the red onion(can be rings, or slivers) and fry with remaining olive oil in a deep pan. Once the onion softens, add the quartered mushrooms and continue to pan fry at medium / medium high heat.</li>
<li>Once the mushrooms and onions reach a soft and lightly seared consistency, add the tomato paste directly to the pan and toss with a spatula. Turn off the heat once the vegetables are fully coated in tomato pate.</li>
<li>Remove the aubergines from the oven and allow to cool; once cold enough to handle, cut roasted aubergine into 2-3cm chunks. Drain the potatoes and let residual moisture evaporate for 2 minutes. Combine aubergie and potatoes and mash together until a homogenous but not smooth consistency is achieved with a masher. Fold in onion, mushroom, tomato portion from the pan.</li>
<li>Serve immediately with a handful of coursely grated sheep cheese on top.</li>
