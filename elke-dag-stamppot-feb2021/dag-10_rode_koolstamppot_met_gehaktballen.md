## Ingredients
For the gehaktballen: 
* 500 g minced meat
* 1 onion
* 3 beschuiten (twice-baked bread)
* 1 egg
* chunk of butter
* some flour
* white pepper, salt, mace (foelie), koriander, paprika powder, nutmeg

For the stamppot: 
* 600 g soft-cooking potatoes (russet works fine)
* 1/2 red cabbage 
* 1 apple 
* 1 yellow onion
* 1 carrot
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
* some water
* some milk and butter 
* salt and pepper 

## Preparation
* Finely cut the onion. Mix the minced meat, onion, crushed beschuiten, egg, and spices in a bowl. Mix thoroughly with your hands and form evenly sized balls. 
* Heat the butter in a pan, and when ready add the meat balls rolled in flour. After browning on all sides, turn the heat down and let the meat balls simmer for approx. 40 minutes. 
* While the meat balls are simmering, peal the potatoes and cut them in ~4-5 cm pieces. Boil potatoes for approx. 20 minutes until they are soft. Poor water off, and mash with milk and/or butter to taste. 
* Meanwhile, cut red cabbage, apple, onion, and carrot and place them in a pot with some water, the sugar, and the cinnamon. Let the mixture simmer for approx. 25 minutes. 
* Mix the red cabbage mixture with the mashed potatoes.
