## Festive Mulled wine for cold weather occasions
Preparation time: 30 minutes
4 servings (180ml mug)  

## Ingredients
* 1 standard bottle (750ml) of red wine (I like a juicy syrah/tempranillo)
* 10 whole cloves
* 5 dried star anise 
* 1 small/medium orange cut in half
* 1/2 lemon 
* 2 cinnamon sticks
* 100g whte granulated sugar
* (optoional) bourbon 

## Preparation
* Empty the bottle of red wine into a small pan and warm under medium heat to just before boiling point. If the wine starts to boil, bring temperature down immediately to keep hot without letting it reach a rolling boil.
* Peel the rind off of the lemon-half with a citrus peeler or sharp paring knife.* Peel the rind off of the lemon-half with a citrus peeler or sharp paring knife.
* Add the cloves, start anise, both orange halves, lemon, lemon rind, and cinnamon sticks into the red wine.
* Stir in the whte sugar and then keep stirring the whole concoction periodically for 15-20 minutes.
* Roughly crush the citrus fruits (orange and lemon) against the bottom of the pan with a wooden stirring spoon to release some of the juices. Do not juice the fruits or aim to pulverize the fruits, just squish them against the side of the pot after they have had a chance to stew in the red wine.
* Serve in festive mugs, hot out of the pot with an (optional) shot of bourbon.
* More wine and sugar can be added to the pot to scale this recipe to more servings (up to 8-12 total servings). However, longer duration on heat is needed to diffuse the flavours from this set of spices and fruits.
