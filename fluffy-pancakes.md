_Fried_, _vegetarian_, _comfort_. _breakfast_, _pancakes_

Preparation time: 5 mins

Cooking time: 10 mins

makes 10-12 pancakes enough for 2 hungry people or 2 normal people and 2 tiny children

## Ingredients
* 2 cups all purpose (300 g)
* 2 tsps granulated sugar 
* 1 small packet fine vanilla sugar 
* 4 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/2 flat teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 3/4 cups milk, (440ml)
* 1/4 cup butter, melted and slightly cooled (60g)
* 1 large egg
* neutral oil for frying

## Preparation 
* Combine all dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, vanilla sugar, salt) in a mixing bowl and combine until homogeneous.
* Add milk, then eggs, then melted butter in quick succession with mixer going at medium speed.
* Mix for 1 minute while bringing pancake pans up to medium (medium-low) heat. Lower heat is better as you will get a golden brown surface and a fluffy cooked interior. One doesn't need to rush pancakes.
* Using a 1/4 cup measuring cup (or other comparable volume-bearing vessel), dole out 1 pancake portion of batter. 
* [optional] add blueberries, nuts, fruits, grains, oils onto the upward side of a pancake while it starts to cook from the underside.
* When small bubbles form throughout the surface, it's time to flip the pancake.
* Serve warm with arbitrary toppings.
