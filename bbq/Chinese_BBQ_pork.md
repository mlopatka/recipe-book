# Char Siu (叉燒) - Chinese BBQ Pork
*Dad's Authentic Recipe by Made with Lau*

You can make this in a large toaster oven set to roast. You do not need an oven or a BBQ to make this. 

## Time
- **Prep time:** 15 minutes
- **Marinating time:** 6-8 hours (or overnight). 8 is ideal. 6 is totally acceptable in a pinch. Don't go longer than 24 hours. 
- **Cook time:** 50 minutes
- **Total time:** 7-9 hours (including marinating)

## Ingredients

### For the Pork
- 3 lb (1.4 kg) pork shoulder (or a fatty cut)

### For the Marinade
- 24g garlic salt (1.5 tbsp)
- 60g brown sugar (6 tbsp)
- 50g oyster sauce (3 tbsp)
- 60g light soy sauce (3 tbsp)
- 24g hoisin sauce (1.5 tbsp)
- 30g red wine (3 tbsp)
- 24g Shaoxing wine (1.5 tbsp)
- 1.5 to 2 cubes red fermented bean curd
- Five spice powder (1.5 tsp)
### For Basting

We're basting with 2 different sauces in 4 rounds. 

- Reserve a half cup of the marinade for the first 2 rounds of basting. 
- Use a honey sauce for the last 2.

Diluted honey baste:
- 42g honey (3 tbsp)
- 10g water (3 tsp)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare & Poke Meat
Cut the pork shoulder along the grain into long slices, roughly about 1 inch thick. Poke holes all over the pork, front and back, to help the marinade penetrate.

### Step 2: Prepare Marinade
In a bowl, combine all marinade ingredients:
- Garlic salt
- Brown sugar
- Oyster sauce
- Light soy sauce
- Hoisin sauce
- Red wine
- Shaoxing wine
- Red fermented bean curd (mash it up)
- Five spice powder
- Red food coloring (optional)

Mix well until combined.

### Step 3: Marinate Pork
Place the meat into a ziplock bag, pour the sauce in, and massage the pork for about 2 minutes so that the sauce can work its way into the meat. Marinate for 6-8 hours, or overnight in the refrigerator for best results.

### Step 4: Prepare Char Siu for Oven
1. Preheat the oven to 425°F
2. Line the bottom of a baking pan with aluminum foil (makes cleaning easier)
3. Place a baking rack on top of the foil
4. Using tongs, lay out the pork on the baking rack
5. Add 1-2 tbsp of water to the bottom of the pan to help generate steam and prevent drippings from burning

### Step 5: Cook and Baste
Prepare the honey mixture by combining honey and water.

Cook the char siu in cycles:
1. **Cook for 15 minutes** - Remove and lather both sides with leftover pork marinade
2. **Cook for another 15 minutes** - Remove and lather both sides with pork marinade again
3. **Cook for 10 minutes** - Remove and lather both sides with the diluted honey
4. **Turn heat up to 450°F** - Remove and lather both sides with the diluted honey. Cook for a final 5 minutes to get that caramelized char

### Step 6: Rest and Serve
Let the char siu rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Slice and serve hot with rice, noodles, or vegetables.

## Tips
- Use a fatty cut of pork (like pork shoulder or pork belly) for the juiciest results
- The longer you marinate (up to overnight), the better the flavor
- Reserve some marinade before adding the raw pork if you want to use it for basting
- The char siu can be used in fried rice, noodle soups, or enjoyed on its own
- **Red wine substitute:** You can replace the red wine with additional Shaoxing wine, mirin, dry sherry, or omit it entirely
- **Marinating:** 8 hours is usually sufficient. For same-day cooking, marinate in the morning and leave at room temperature in the bag. Refrigeration is only needed if marinating overnight
- **Room temperature cooking:** Always cook meat from room temperature for best results. If refrigerated, let cold meat rest on the counter for 1 hour before cooking
