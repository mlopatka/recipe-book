## Ingredients

* 1 whole, free range chicken or large Cornish hen (1.5-2kg)
* 1/2 cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil depending on preference
* Juice of 1 lemon (save 1 half of the lemon rind after juicing)
* 3 Tablespoons Soy Sauce
* 2 Tablespoons Balsamic Vinegar
* 1/4 cup Brown Sugar
* 1 Tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce
* 10 Garlic Cloves (or one full bulb of garlic)
* 1 Tablespoon of sweet paprika powder
* Coarse salt and fresh black pepper rub
* (optional) apple cider vinegar 

## Instructions

* Using a food processor, puree the garlic with half of the olive.
* In a bowl, stir together oil, lemon juice, soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, paprika.
* Rinse the chicken including inside the cavity with cold water and pat dry with a paper towel.
* using a heavy cleaver split the chicken in a sagittal plane (into two equal halves, lengthwise along the spine).
* Pat dry the inside of the halved chicken and then rub the inside of the cavity with salt and pepper.
* Let marinate in tightly sealed plastic bag overnight for best results (at very least 5-6 hours)

* Preheat grill to high heat, alternatively bring charcoal grill up to high heat.
* Brush grill with oil to prevent sticking.
* Place chicken halves salt/pepper rubbed side down on the grill. Cook for approximately 6-10 minutes, using apple cider vinegar or water spray to control flare-ups. 
* Flip over to skin-side and let cook covered for an additional 10-15 minutes. 
* Flip over frequently in growing flames to finish the sear (it's ok if the outer skin is quite charred, you can discard this before serving if you want).
* The internal temperature of the chicken should reach 75C (165F) degrees.
* Remove chicken from grill and let rest in foil for 5-10 minutes.
