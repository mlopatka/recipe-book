## Instructions

These istructions are for semi-smoked brisket on a conventional propane BBQ grill. 
Directions using a charcoal grill or a dedicated hot/cold smoker will vary.

- Preheat BBQ to just over 110 C (230 F) and add a pan with wood chips and a pot of water to maintain humidity.
- Rinse, clean, and pat dry the brisket.
- Combine the rub ingredients (this should be a thick/viscous paste that will stick to the meat and work itself into the grain).
- Place brisket in the BBQ and turn heat down to the lowest possible setting.
- Wait... 8 hours.
- Keep the BBQ temperature at about 105 C (220 F) periodically replenishing the water pot as needed.
- To increase tenderness, you may take the brisket out of the BBQ after 6 hours, wrap it in aluminum foil and place in an oven at 80 - 90 C (180 to 200 F) for the last two hours.
- Let the brisket rest (wrapped in foil) for **at least** 30 minutes before carving.
