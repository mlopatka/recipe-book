# Cookbook
A collection of the various recipes I've gathered/collected. PRs welcome

## Format:
I'd prefer measurements to be in metric when possible. For temperatures, please redundantly list both Celcius and Farenheit.

Ideally, each recipe will have the format of:

|  |
| --- |
| * Ingredients |
| * Preperation |
| * Cooking |
| --- |
| * Contextual/Cultural information or origin of the recipe.
