* 2 carrots
* 2 eggs 
* 3 red beets 
* lots of mayonaise 
* grated mild cheese (e.g., havarti cheese)

## Preparation
* Boil the beets for 45 - 60 mins. Peel them and let them cool completely.

* Finely chop the half onion and the herring. 
* In a large oven dish, start layering. Start with (coarsely) grated potatoe, then the finely chopped onion. Continue with finely chopped herrings, topped by a layer of grated carrots.
* Then add a layer of grated eggs, mixed with some mayonaise. On top of the egg layer, add grated beets. Finish with a thick layer of mayonaise, topped by grated cheese.
