## Ingredients
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1-2 medium yellow onions, coarsely chopped
- 6 large yellow/orange/red bell peppers (capsicum)
- 3 large aubergines (eggplant)
- 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 2 large (796ml/28oz) cans of peeled crushed tomatoes
- 400-500g cooked leftover lamb meat, diced to 1-1.5cm cubes (substitute for minced lamb)
- 1 lemon
- 3 bay leaves
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 2 tablespoons kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon sweet paprika powder
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1/2 tablespoon cinnamon
- 1 tablespoon caraway seed 
- 8 large eggs (typically 2 eggs per person poached right before serving)

## Preparation

1. Grill whole capsicums and aubergines over lowest heat on a BBQ for 30-60 minutes, or oven roast at 110C (230F).

2. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large dutch oven or stewing pot. Add the onions, garlic, lamb meat and saut√© over high heat until sizzling. Add all spices (bay leaves, sugar, salt, paprika, cinnamon, caraway, cumin) and stir.

2. Slowly pour in the tomatoes and let the mixture simmer on low heat until you are ready to add the grilled vegetables.

3. Take the grilled capsicum and aubergine off the grill and let them cool enough to handle. Then  core, trim, and coarsely dice aubergine and capsicums. Add this to the simmering mixture. 

4. Squeeze the fresh lemon juice into the mixture and stir thoroughly. Let simmer until the pot has been bubbling for about an hour and all vegetables are softening to the point where ingredients are blending.  

5. Crack (1-2 eggs per person/serving) into a distinct region of the tomato mixture and using a cooking spoon create a small well underneath the egg so that it submerges in the boiling liquid. Cover and simmer for approximately 10 minutes or until the whites of the eggs are no longer translucent.
